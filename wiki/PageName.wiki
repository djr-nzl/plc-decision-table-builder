Use a spreadsheet to design and test a small simple decision table.
It uses conditional formatting to highlight various cells.
And VBA to generate code that can be pasted directly into a Rockwell AB Control Logix PLC a RLL.

  # While the initial release is in excel - I am keen to convert it to Open Office.
  # Its easy enough to add the scripts to generate PLC5 RLL and its next on the list.

There is only one download - it also contains the source and some cell comments to help get one started - for more information please feel free to contact me.

I have been improving the template by adding a VBA sub that simulates 1 scan of the PLC and updates any inputs to the decision table that are outputs - i.e feedbacks, latches, edge detectors and the like.
