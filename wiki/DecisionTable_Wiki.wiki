 * And extra finally use VBA to produce logic that can be pasted directly into a Control Logix PLC in RLL.

  * While the initial releases are in excel - I am keen to convert it to Open Office.
  * It's easy enough to add the scripts to generate (say) PLC5 RLL (its next on the list).

= Help =

 * There is no help at present aside from a short video showing its use.
 * I hope to create a better help soon.
