# Introduction #

  * Use a spreadsheet to design and test a small and simple decision table.
  * Use conditional formatting to highlight various cells.
  * And finally use VBA to generate code, and provide functionality to assist design and test.
  * And extra finally use VBA to produce logic that can be pasted directly into a Control Logix PLC in RLL.


# Details #

  * While the initial releases are in excel - I am keen to convert it to Open Office.
  * It's easy enough to add the scripts to generate (say) PLC5 RLL (its next on the list).

# Help #

  * There is no help at present aside from a short video showing its use.
  * I hope to create a better help soon.
