h3. Version 2 - 6 October 2009

Alpha Centrus release.

Usable as a toy - no code generation.

**To do**
# Code generator.
# Drag and drop for rearranging inputs, outputs and rules.
# Server back end with ajax save and load - using camping app.
# Rule description popup.
# Turn Scanner on and off and change scan time.
# Other stuff.

See http://code.google.com/p/plc-decision-table-builder/ for more information.

This app uses jQuery.
See http://docs.jquery.com/ for more information.

The file PLCDTbl.rb is a Camping App, camping is a micro frame work by _why the lucky stiff in Ruby.
See http://camping.rubyforge.org/ for more information.

A camping app needs Ruby and everone has Ruby installed, right?
See http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

For Windows there is a 1 click installer.
Once its installed break open a command line thing, a command shell.
And type in something like gem install camping
You may need to install a few other gems - I will update this list soon.

More to follow.

The 3 files making up this app are free, they are yours already.
# PLCDTbl.rb
# plc_dtbl.css
# plc_dtbl.js

a 4th file, a dependency, jquery.js has its own licensce - please read it - its in the file.
