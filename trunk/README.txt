The file PLCDTbl.rb is a Camping App, camping is a micro frame work by _why the lucky stiff in Ruby.
See http://camping.rubyforge.org/ for more information.

A camping app needs Ruby and everone has Ruby installed, right?
See http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

For Windows there is a 1 click installer.
Once its installed break open a command line thing, a command shell.
And type in something like gem install camping
You may need to install a few other gems - I will update this list soon.
